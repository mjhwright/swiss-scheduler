# swiss-scheduler
This is a simple Swiss tournament scheduler for use in schools. Its advantage is that absent players do not upset the tournament round. All players present will get to play their most suitable opponent and, if there are an odd number of players present, one will play the coach. 

This implementation solves the Swiss pairing problem using the Blossom algorithm.
